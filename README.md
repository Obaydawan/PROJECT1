Website Project: Cynthia Ugwu Clone

This project is a detailed clone of Cynthia Ugwu's website that I built to sharpen my web development skills. I carefully recreated the design, layout, and functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring that the site is fully responsive and visually consistent with the original. This project highlights my ability to replicate intricate web designs and my attention to detail in front-end development.
